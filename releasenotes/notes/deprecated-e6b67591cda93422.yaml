prelude: >
    Paunch has been replaced by tripleo_container_manage role in
    tripleo-ansible  during Ussuri cycle.
    It is not tested anymore in this version and will be removed one day.
    It it strongly encouraged to switched to the Ansible role to manage
    containers; which should be the default if you deploy TripleO from
    master at this time.
    If you get the warning, it's possible that a parameter (EnablePaunch) is
    set to True; while the default was switched.
    Paunch will remain supported in Ussuri and backward, but not in Victoria
    and forward.
